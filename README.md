**Calculator**: This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a calculator that can perform basic math operations.

**Pizza Project**: This project simulates a website for a pizza restaurant where users can order a pizza by selecting the size of the pizza along with different toppings. The project uses JavaScript to calculate the total price of the pizza and displays the details of the user's order.

**Tic Tac Toe**: This project lets the user play a game of Tic Tac Toe against a computer. JavaScript was used to make the game operational by allowing the user to take turns with the computer, randomizing the computer's action, recognizing win/tie conditions, and more.

**To Do App**: This is a project that simulates a To Do App. Utilizing JavaScript, the user is able to input new tasks into the app, have the app display all the tasks currently active, and remove specific tasks by clicking a button.
